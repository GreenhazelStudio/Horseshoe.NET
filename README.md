# Introduction 
Horseshoe.NET is a suite of .NET utilities with a dual purpose: simplify coding tasks and offer a variety of new and unique features.  

For over 10 years in my career in software development I have been collecting helpful code snippets and identifying tons of reusable boilerplate code and combining it all into a massive library which I now wish to share with other .NET developers everywhere.

# Getting Started
Download the Horseshoe.NET NuGet packages to your app today and start discovering time-saving methods and cool new functionality!

# Contribute
At this time I do not have any other contributors, however, I more than welcome any feedback, feature requests, bug reports... anything to make this software package more reliable as well as user-friendly.  Thanks!
